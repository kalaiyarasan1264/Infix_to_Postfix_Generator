# Infix_to_Postfix_Simulator
Compiler Design Mini Project

Creating an Infix to Postfix Simulator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves building an interactive web application that allows users to input infix expressions and visualizes the conversion process to postfix notation. The user interface, styled with CSS, provides a clean and intuitive design. HTML forms capture user input, and JavaScript functions handle the logic of the conversion. The simulator dynamically updates the display to show each step of the conversion, making the process transparent and user-friendly. Overall, this combination of technologies ensures a responsive and engaging experience for users exploring the transformation from infix to postfix expressions.
